       "\n",
       "This is a Python snippet that uses a combination of generator expressions and dictionary lookup to extract a specific value from an iterable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's break it down:\n",
       "\n",
       "* `yield from`: This keyword is used to delegate the execution of a generator to another generator. In this case, we're using it to yield values from another generator.\n",
       "* `{}`: An empty set literal in Python is used to create a dictionary-like object. However, in this context, it's not actually creating a dictionary. Instead, it's being used as an expression to define a generator expression.\n",
       "* `book.get('author')`: This is a dictionary lookup operation that retrieves the value associated with the key `'author'` from each book object (`book`) in the `books` iterable.\n",
       "* `{ ... for book in books if book.get('author')}`: This is the generator expression itself. It iterates over the `books` iterable, but only includes elements for which the dictionary lookup `book.get('author')` returns a truthy value (i.e., not None or an empty string). The resulting values are then yielded from this expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "**What does it do?**\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, this code generates an iterator that yields the author names of books in the `books` iterable. If a book doesn't have an `'author'` key, its value is considered Falsey (i.e., ignored).\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's some sample data to illustrate this:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {'title': 'Book 1', 'author': 'John Doe'},\n",
       "    {'title': 'Book 2', 'author': None},  # No author specified\n",
       "    {'title': 'Book 3', 'publisher': 'ABC'}\n",
       "]\n",
       "\n",
       "yield from {book.get('author') for book in books if book.get('author')}\n",
       "```\n",
       "Output:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "['John Doe', None]\n",
       "```\n",
       "As you can see, the second book's `'author'` value is ignored because it's not truthy.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why use this code?**\n",
       "\n",
       "This code is likely used in a scenario where you have an iterable of books and want to extract their author names. The `yield from` syntax makes it easy to create an iterator that delegates to another generator expression, which can be useful when working with complex data structures like nested lists or dictionaries."

       "\n",
       "1. The method is declared as an expression-bodied member (`=> Age >= 18;`).\n",
       "2. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the person is an adult.\n",
       "3. The condition for determining adulthood is `Age >= 18`. This means that if the person's age is greater than or equal to 18, they are considered an adult.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Usage**\n",
       "\n",
       "To use this class and method, you can create a new instance of the `Person` class, set their age, and then call the `IsAdult` method to determine whether they're an adult:\n",
       "```csharp\n",
       "var person = new Person { Name = \"John Doe\", Age = 25 };\n",

       "const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
       "```\n",
       "Here, we define an array `nums` with five integer values: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n",

       "```javascript\n",

       "```\n",
       "Here's what happens:\n",
       "\n",
       "* The `map()` method is a built-in JavaScript function that applies a transformation to each element in an array.\n",
       "* In this case, we're applying a transformation function (an arrow function) to each element `n` in the `nums` array.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Arrow function**\n",
       "\n",
       "The arrow function `n => n * n` takes one argument, `n`, and returns its square:\n",
       "```javascript\n",
       "n => n * n\n",
       "```\n",

       "  return n * n;\n",
       "}\n",

       "The `map()` method applies the `n => n * n` function to each element in the `nums` array. This means that:\n",
       "\n",
       "* The first element `[1]` becomes `[1 * 1] = [1]`\n",
       "* The second element `[2]` becomes `[2 * 2] = [4]`\n",

       "const squared = [...]; // here, we assign the result of map() to squared\n",
       "```\n",
       "However, since `map()` returns an array, you can also omit the assignment and simply use the returned value directly.\n",

       "\n",
       "Finally, the code logs the resulting transformed array `squared` to the console using `console.log()`:\n",
